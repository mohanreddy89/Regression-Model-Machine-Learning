# Regression-Model-Machine-Learning
The Boston Housing dataset is a classic benchmark for regression machine learning models. It describes housing prices in suburbs of Boston and includes features like crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to highways. The goal is to use these features to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.

Here's a breakdown of how it's commonly used:

Regression Models: Linear regression is a popular starting point, but other models like Ridge, Lasso, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and even decision tree-based models like Random Forest Regression can be applied.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared, which indicates how well the predicted prices match the actual values.
Feature Selection: Some features might be irrelevant or redundant. Techniques like correlation analysis can help identify the most impactful features for the model.
